# Phase 2 backlog

Issue bodies are self-contained. File them on the working fork (`naryandesai/hydrogen`). `gh` is installed but this machine is not logged in (`gh auth login`).

Reference numbering matches [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-pyrolysis-phase-admissibility.md).

| ID | Title | Type |
|---|---|---|
| [B1](B1-solid-site-inventory.md) | Solid site inventory without inventing Γ | implementation |
| [B2](B2-solids-outfeed-clearing.md) | Solids outfeed / clearing during produce | implementation |
| [B3](B3-mmbcr-bubble-flotation.md) | MMBCR k·a·τ is a sanity check, not kinetic closure | docs + tests |
| [B4](B4-pfr-residence-time-limits.md) | PFR τ limits | implementation |
| [B5](B5-phase2-x-gate-before-dft.md) | **Gate:** do not send Phase 2 X to DFT until PFR/fluidized closure | milestone blocker |
